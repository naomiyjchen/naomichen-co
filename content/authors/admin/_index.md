## **Academics & Research**

I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles in 2020 with a B.S. in applied mathematics and a specialization in computing. 

To advance my research skills, I'm currently working as a Research Machine Learning Engineer at Academic Sinica, in Taipei, Taiwan. I'm contributing to the project *To Digitally Innovate Academic Settings* by the Institute of History and Philology. My work focuses on conducting attention analysis and coreference resolution on historical texts from ancient China.

## **Career Goal and Interest**

One of my career interests lies in leveraging machine learning models to help business make well-informed decisions and introducing labor-saving technologies to traditional business.

Since college, I've worked part time for my family business and become more involved as I graduated. From this experience, I learned the value of team work, management, negotiation and communication and was fascinated by the many working parts it takes to operate a successful business.  I also saw the possibility of significant improvement if we were able to adopt new technologies in business.

In the future, I hope to gather likeminded people and work to push toward this innovative change.

## **About Math and Teaching**

During my free time, I sometimes teach children math. I see this as a way of giving back to society. Learning mathematics has help me build a growth mindset and good logical reasoning skills, so I truly believe that children can be benefited by having a positive attitude toward math.
